Subject: DOC Label Issue

To whom it may concern,

I am trying to compare hemophilia labels, but ran into an issue with the availability of those labels in the DOC Label system.  Specifically, I was searching for ADVATE, NOVOEIGHT, and RIXUBIS.  I initially looked up NOVOEIGHT.  When there
were no results, I figured there may have been an issue since it was recently approved.  However, I then searched for ADVATE as that was approved in 2003, but no results were found.  I also did a search on Daily Med to see what is available.  It seems that
the ADVATE and RIXUBIS labels are available, but NOVOEIGHT is not.  Is there any action that can be taken to gain access to these labels?

While fulfilling a client request for the drug (brand) name Mekinist and Tafinlar, I noticed that the information in DOC&#8482; Label section “SPL Unclassified Section” (US List) has a lot of information (see screenshot below).

But, if you export this section using the “Export Comparisons to Excel” (see attachment or screenshot below), only the first section gets exported; meaning a lot of the information is left out of exports.

Can you take a look and make sure that the entire section is included in exports? Please let me know when you will have a chance to investigate and fix the issue.

Tanya reported another error. It appears to be essentially the same error as the one Katia reported. Basically the reason why ""no sections within the “Select
Section to Compare” box are highlighted” is because the search matrix export (see attachment) only reports
items that are in the within the “Section[s] to compare” and because the title is not a part of it, nothing is being highlighted or exported for those drugs. To resolve the issue and add clarity for users, could you add
a new option within the “Section[s] to compare” for the title and include it in exports?

There is a second issue of “medication error” not being included in the export that Katia already mentioned. It can be resolved in the “Amgen label issue #1” task.

1. The search results in 23 labels, however only 10 are exported. I think this is most likely due to the fact that ""injectable"" is found within label title (attached label for Lipodox is an example), but is confusing to the client. 

2. However, a bigger issue is that ""medication error*"" is not appearing in the export at all. 

Could you please take a look?

Thank you,

Edan,

We had a brief call this morning with Tanya from Amgen about an issue she was having with IE9 on DOC Label. She was unable to select or unselect label sections
in the lower left panel. The issue is described in the linked webex recording, in the first 5 minutes.

This issue seems to be caused by the Amgen installation of IE9, and is resolved by using Chrome. Therefore, we’ve suggested to all Amgen users to use Chrome,
and request permission from IT if necessary. We should still take a look at the issue, but it is not critical.

Thanks,

Toby

It appears that the mapping of the section 6.4 Special Precautions for Storage duplicates the content in section 6.3 Shelf Life in the SPC labels. As an example, I ran a search for the SPC label adalimumab. In a DOC&#8482; Label search for section 6.4, the system
only shows section 6.3 twice (see below).

But, if you view this same label via the “View on EMC link” (http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/21201#SHELF_LIFE <http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/21201#SHELF_LIFE>), the section 6.4 does exist with content different than section
6.3 (see below).
.

Our best guess was the the section 6.4 had section 6.3 mapped to it. Could you please investigate what the problem might be and fix it, if possible? If the problem is not fixable by the end of the day tomorrow (4/17 PST), could you give us a timeline on
when it could be resolved?

Hi Doctor Evidence,

When trying to pull information for Section “6.4 Special precautions for storage” in Doctor Evidence for SPC labels, the database is pulling Section “6.3 Shelf life” instead.  This is for both the section comparison and when you view any
of the SPC labels.  See screenshot example below.

Brittany Goettsch <https://app.asana.com/0/10795882762493/10795882762493> : We have fixed the search matrix issue by splitting the search
keyword by ""Near"".

But we are still trying to fix it with full search keyword.

We will resolve this and update you tomorrow evening.

Brittany Goettsch <https://app.asana.com/0/10795882762493/10795882762493> There is no bug in search and highlight.
There is a bug with Search Matrix which we are looking at.

The 81 results fetched are correct. When you highlight, it does'nt highlight both keywords within 9 words of each other, but highlights both of them seperately. So you will find atleast one section in the Labels listed which will have both keywords within 9
words of each other which was found by searching DB. In this case, I am finding most of them in Dosage and Administration.

Dear Toby,

I did try the steps below but was not sure what check boxes were safe to check with regards to type of information to remove. One of them, was about
disabling some security features. As I am not a computer wiz I will ask someone at the office to assist me with this.

Hi Christine,

The UK SmPCs can be viewed via the version of the label with the UK flag (screenshot below). You may need to clear your browser cache for these labels to be
visible.

Also, the CCDS for BMS is still being configured, I will send out an email update ASAP when it is available.

Dear Toby,

Could you please refresh my memory and tell me how to view UK SmPCs on doctor evidence? I have initiated several searches where I know that the product
is available in the US as well as in Europe, but the only labels that come up are the USPIs.  At the bottom left corner of the screen, under Select section to compare, the drop down arrow only gives the option of
US list.

Additionally, both my colleague and I do not seem to have the
Add CCDS push button (top right).

Thank you.

Amit,

Please map the attached three CCDS Word documents into DOC Label for AbbVie. They will require a different format than the existing XML mapping, so we need to allow them to choose between formats in their “Add CDS” dialog box. This will require building
a new drop down menu specific to the client. For now, the two options for AbbVie’s drop down should be:

XML Format CCDS
Word Format CCDS
Also, Please change the “Add CDS” button to read simply “Upload.”

These are not an immediate priority, but let’s aim to finish by end of next week if possible.

Subject: Re: URGENT FW: Unfortunately, the software is utilizing my search criteria as ³OR² instead of ³AND²

Point 1: if you select multiple sections, the search within them is always ""or"". So in Tanya's case, search query would be
Pregnancy contains category c and
Box Warning Section or W&P or Warnings Section contains pregnancy

The behaviour is correct, as if we default to ""and"" in multi select the results will be very less. Hence it defaults to ""or"" for within multi selected sections.

Point 2: please tell me the exact steps to reproduce.

Thanks.

2. Optionally you can select a few others
3. Click on one of the previously selected sections (to deselect it) and the whole list either jumps up or down until it displays the next selected section.

Hi Toby,

There are lots of changes in the section and hence it has shown complete section change.

If you notice 1.* sections have been completely removed and hence it changes the internal dom layout of the document. In comparision, both the sections are completely different (Layout wise) and hence it has marked complete section as new.

Subject: Dr. Evidence search - more detailed comparison needed

Hi Toby,

I did a Dr. Evidence search comparing the most recent Simponi US Jan2014 label to the previous Simponi US Nov2013 label.  It ended up striking out the entire Instructions for Use
and adding in the new Instructions for Use instead of showing me the exact changes that were made, which were supposed to be minor changes to this section.  Did I do this comparison correctly in Dr. Evidence?  Is there a way to get a more detailed comparison
document?  I have attached the results I got from my search for your reference.  Thanks.

Kind regards,

Hi All,

Please see screen shots for comparison of the following labels:  abacavir sulfate (ViiV), lamivudine (ViiV) and emtricitabine + tenofovir, i.e. truvada (Gilead).

To get all three originally on one page, I need pick 11x17 paper in page layout.  It gives me the following.  As you can see, the Gilead label is very wide.

If I then try to adjust the column width by distributing the columns evenly, I get the following.  Although there appears to be plenty of room to display the PK table for truvada it squishes it all to one side.

Here is an example of the problem I had before with the sideways arrows in these tables becoming really big when trying to adjust the column width.

I hope this helps.

Hi Stuart,

Thank you for sending me this feedback! Could you send me a bit more context around what labels were exported? Screenshots of the labels or the export would be helpful in tracking down the issue.

Also, great to finally meet you in person yesterday. We got on one of the last flights out from RDU after the meeting. Hope you didn&rsquo;t get too much snow.

Thanks,

Toby

Toby:
Thought I would forward this comment to you.  Not sure if you have seen this problem before but I can follow-up if you need more info.

HI Stuart,

One comment after using the tool.  Not sure if it is specific to the tool or the docs they are pulling in but found some difficulties with the Gilead labels in the clin pharm sections.  If the sideways arrow
was used, this was at a very big size that I wasn&rsquo;t able to easily scale down.  This made it hard to display multiple labels on the same page in word.  Don&rsquo;t know if there is anything they can do around this formatting.  Otherwise once you showed me the comparison
section, I found the tool easy to use.

Regards,

Stuart

One helpful piece of data might be the NDF-RT NUI code, which is a unique identifier per drug classification. Can you tell if this information is embeded in the SPL?

Link to FDA drug class files: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/UCM346147.zip

• Ingredient 
• NDC Code
• Drug Class (besides EPC)

Guys,

We have the section repeat behavior in the version comparison tool. Please look at US Humira label version 1560 compared to 1415. Adverse reactions sections 6.1 and 6.2 have duplicate repeats.

My guess is it’s the same issue we found with the repeating codes. Please let me know.

To whom it may concern,

Another question I have is in regard to the exporting of comparator labels.  I have attempted to export 3 labels to Word.  Unfortunately, when it opens up in Word, the 3 columns all differ in width and 1&#381;2 of the 3rd column falls off the page.  I was able to resize the widths, etc., but is there a way to ensure that the comparison is nicely placed on the page so that I do not have to make these adjustments.

It was brought up at the Label demo with Mylan pharmaceuticals today that DailyMed may have unapproved labels and that manufacturers may submit/ or not submit a label change that was not yet FDA approved, for example and therefore they are likely go to the Drugs at FDA website for the most accurate and up to date information.

DailyMed landing page has the following info below re unapproved labels. Are we able to track these in our software?
